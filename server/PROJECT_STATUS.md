## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Start Server
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### 2. Connect from Unity
```csharp
WebSocket ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080");
```

## 📡 WebSocket API

### Message Types (Client → Server)
- `join_queue` - Join matchmaking
- `leave_queue` - Leave matchmaking
- `roll_dice` - Roll dice on your turn
- `move_token` - Move a token
- `get_state` - Get current game state
- `leave_game` - Exit game
- `reconnect` - Reconnect after disconnect

### Message Types (Server → Client)
- `connected` - Connection established
- `queue_update` - Queue status changed
- `match_found` - Game starting
- `dice_rolled` - Dice roll result
- `token_moved` - Token moved
- `game_over` - Game finished
- `error` - Error occurred
- `player_disconnected` - Player left
- `player_reconnected` - Player returned

---

## 🎮 Game Rules

- **Players**: 2-4
- **Tokens per player**: 4
- **Goal**: Get all 4 tokens home first
- **Start**: Roll 6 to exit base
- **Safe tiles**: 0, 13, 26, 39
- **Roll again**: On 6, eviction, or reaching home
- **Third six**: Turn ends automatically
- **Blockades**: 2+ same-color tokens block path
- **Eviction**: Land on opponent → back to base

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
PORT=8080  # Default WebSocket port
```

### Production Deployment
- Use PM2 for process management

## 🎓 For Unity Developers

### Required Unity Package
Any WebSocket client library:
- NativeWebSocket (recommended)
- WebSocketSharp
- BestHTTP

### Integration Steps
1. Install WebSocket library in Unity
2. Connect to `ws://yourserver:8080`
3. Handle `connected` message to get player ID
4. Send `join_queue` to start matchmaking
5. Handle `match_found` to initialize game
6. Handle `dice_rolled` and `token_moved` for gameplay
7. Send `roll_dice` and `move_token` on player actions

See **API.md** for complete Unity C# examples!

## 📞 Support

### Common Issues

**"You are already in a game"**
→ Use `leave_game` first

**"Not your turn"**
→ Wait for your `playerIndex` to match `currentPlayer`

**"Invalid move"**
→ Only use tokens from `validMoves` array

**Can't connect**
→ Verify server is running on correct port

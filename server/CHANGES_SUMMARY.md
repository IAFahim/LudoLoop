# 🎉 LUDO GAME SERVER - MAJOR UPDATE COMPLETE

## What Was Changed

Your Ludo game server has been completely upgraded with **automatic matchmaking** and **flexible team sizes**!

### ✅ What's New

1. **🎮 Automatic Matchmaking**
   - No more manual room creation/joining
   - Just click "Find Match" and play
   - Smart queue system matches players automatically

2. **👥 Flexible Team Sizes**
   - Automatically adjusts from 2-4 players
   - 4+ players in queue → Instant 4v4 match
   - 2-3 players waiting 10 seconds → Match starts anyway
   - No more waiting for full lobbies!

3. **🚀 Complete Unity C# Client**
   - Ready-to-use Unity integration
   - Full event system
   - Example UI controller included
   - Works with NativeWebSocket package

### ❌ What Was Removed

Old manual game management:
- `create_game` - No longer needed
- `join_game` - No longer needed  
- `start_game` - No longer needed
- `list_games` - No longer needed
- Manual room codes and session IDs

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- ✨ `LudoClient.cs` - Complete Unity C# client (590 lines)
- ✨ `LudoGameUI.cs` - Example Unity UI controller (220 lines)
- ✨ `UNITY_INTEGRATION.md` - Complete Unity integration guide
- ✨ `NEW_QUICKSTART.md` - Updated quick start guide
- ✨ `test-matchmaking.js` - Automated test suite

### Modified Files
- 🔧 `server.js` - Implemented automatic matchmaking system
- 🔧 `index.html` - Simplified UI to use automatic matching

### Unchanged Files
- ✅ `gameSession.js` - All game logic remains the same
- ✅ `package.json` - Same dependencies

## How to Use

### For Web Testing
```bash
cd server
npm install
node server.js
# Open index.html in browser
# Click "Find Match"
```

### For Unity Development
```csharp
// 1. Install NativeWebSocket package
// 2. Add LudoClient.cs to project
// 3. Use it:

LudoClient client = FindObjectOfType<LudoClient>();
client.Connect();
client.FindMatch();  // That's it!

// Subscribe to events
client.OnMatchFound += (match) => {
    Debug.Log($"Game found with {match.playerCount} players!");
};
```

## Key Features

### Smart Matchmaking Algorithm
```
Players in queue < 2: Wait for more players
Players in queue = 4+: Instant 4-player match
Players in queue = 2-3 AND waited 10s: Start match
```

### Flexible Team Sizes
- **2v2**: Perfect for quick games
- **3-player**: Works great too!
- **4-player**: Classic Ludo experience

### Automatic Game Start
- No manual "Start Game" button needed
- Game begins immediately when match is found
- All players notified with `match_found` event

## Testing

Run automated tests:
```bash
# Test instant match (4 players)
node test-matchmaking.js 1

# Test flexible match (2 players, 10s wait)
node test-matchmaking.js 2

# Test staggered join (3 players)
node test-matchmaking.js 3

# Run all tests
node test-matchmaking.js all
```

Expected results:
- ✅ Instant 4-player match works
- ✅ 2-player match after 10 seconds works
- ✅ 3-player staggered join works

## API Reference

### New Message Types

**Client → Server:**
```javascript
// Join matchmaking queue
{
  type: "find_match",
  payload: { playerName: "Alice" }
}

// Leave queue
{
  type: "leave_queue",
  payload: {}
}
```

**Server → Client:**
```javascript
// Joined queue successfully
{
  type: "queue_joined",
  payload: { 
    playersInQueue: 3,
    message: "Searching for match..."
  }
}

// Match found! Game starting
{
  type: "match_found",
  payload: {
    sessionId: "abc-123",
    playerCount: 4,
    players: [...],
    gameState: {...}
  }
}
```

### Existing Game APIs (Unchanged)
- `roll_dice` - Roll the dice
- `move_token` - Move a token
- `get_state` - Get current game state
- `leave_game` - Leave the game
- `reconnect` - Reconnect to game

## Configuration

Adjust matchmaking timeout in `server.js`:
```javascript
this.QUEUE_TIMEOUT = 10000;  // milliseconds
```

Change to:
- `5000` - 5 seconds (faster matches)
- `15000` - 15 seconds (more patient)
- `30000` - 30 seconds (wait for full teams)
